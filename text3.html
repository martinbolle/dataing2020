<p>This data is presumable based on job-adverts, and the data is collected in the first six months of 2020. Wich was a roller-coaster period for many IT-businesses.</p>
<h3 id="skills">The difficulties of comparing salaries</h3>
<p>the difficulties of comparing salaries, is easyliest illustrated by looking at men versus womans. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-men-womens-salaries-compare-worlds-top-tech-companies-2020-5?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank">comparing salaries by men and womans in big tech-industries</a></p>

<h3 id="gender"Salaries are not just about main skills</h3>
<p>usually, secondary skills are wanted as well. And experience counts alot.</p>
<p>Therefore, please mind thar "median salary" is not <em>first-job pay</em> (not starting positions). So wit a lot of experienced Java-Programmers out there, the median salary may be muck higher than starting salary.</p>

<h1 id="know">Glass doors, ceilings and salary</h1>
<p>If we continue to look at woman and pay, does this mean that we just have to wait and the pay-gap will sort it self out? Preliminary data fro the IT-business is just promissing. A <a href="https://research.hackerrank.com/women-in-tech/2019#intro" target="_blank" title="Women in tech">recent report (from HackerRank)</a> highlight how woman consistently work in more junior posistions than men at the same age.</p>
